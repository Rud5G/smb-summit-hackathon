SAP SMB Innovation Summit Hackathon
=======================
If you have attended any hackathons in the past, then you know how much time it takes to
get a project started: decide on what to build, pick a programming language, pick a web framework. 

Unfortunately we don't have much time for this exercise, therefore we tried to keep things simple so your team can get up to speed quickly and build a great prototype. Don't take the samples as a worldclass code, we took several shortcuts to make sure you onboard quickly. Most importantly, [the quality of your code won't be evaluated](https://github.com/B1SA/hackathon/wiki/FAQ#what-are-the-judgement-criteria).

How It Works
--------------------------

For this hackathon, your team should develop an innovative prototype that leverages one or many services in the SAP Cloud Platform. This prototype should implement a [Loosely Coupled Architecture](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/04/27/digital-transformation-for-smbs-a-blog-series/), making no [or very little] usage of components in the backend systems (SAP Business One and/or SAP Business ByDesign).

That means no SDK is required to create your prototype. The ERPs should be used as black boxes accessed via data APIs. A great example  is explained [in this blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/05/24/digital-transformation-for-smbs-the-intelligent-enterprise/) and several other resources in the [Loosely Coupled Topics for SMBs page](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/06/05/loosely-coupled-solutions-for-smbs-topics).

Understanding the specifics of each service is not trivial. That's why we prepared a [set of Build Blocks](#list-of-build-blocks) that are straightforward to consume and also will help you understand the key concepts from each technology.

Our SAP Experts will be available during the hackathon hours to answer questions and provide advice in case your team needs guidance

Your team will have approximately 7 hours to develop a prototype and present it at the end of the day to a panel of judges and the hackathon audience.

The [Judgement Criteria is in the FAQ](https://github.com/B1SA/hackathon/wiki/FAQ#what-are-the-judgement-criteria) and your final presentation should be of 5 minutes. The three best prototypes will be chosen and the winner announced on Finn Backer's Keynote in the next morning.


Requirements
-------------
#### Cloud Environment

You cloud application prototype will heavily rely on [SAP Cloud Platform](http://cloudplatform.sap.com/) services. So make sure you have:

 - <img src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-256/sap-5-569505.png" height="17">&nbsp; [SAP Cloud Platform Free Trial Account](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html)
 -  <img src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-256/sap-5-569505.png" height="17">&nbsp; [Install Cloud Foundry CLI](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-download-cli.html)
 #### Development Environment
The SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry natively supports many programming languages using the so called [System BuildPacks](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/#system-buildpacks). The [open source community](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-docs-contrib/wiki/Buildpacks#community-created) has also created several other Buildpacks, for [example .Net](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dotnet-core-buildpack). 
With that many runtimes, you can choose the developer environment that best suits you. Here are some examples to get you started:
 

-  <img src="http://deluge-torrent.org/images/apple-logo.gif" height="17">&nbsp;**Mac OS X:** [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) OR [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
 - <img src="http://dc942d419843af05523b-ff74ae13537a01be6cfec5927837dcfe.r14.cf1.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/windows-8-50x50.jpg" height="17">&nbsp;**Windows:** [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs)
 - <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2YS1ceHWyys/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/0LCb_tsTvmU/s46-c-k/photo.jpg" height="17">&nbsp;**Ubuntu** / <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Logo_Linux_Mint.png" height="17">&nbsp;**Linux Mint:** `sudo apt-get install build-essential`
 - <img src="http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/extra/LINUX/small/slw218news1.png" height="17">&nbsp;**Fedora**: `sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"`
 - <img src="https://en.opensuse.org/images/b/be/Logo-geeko_head.png" height="17">&nbsp;**OpenSUSE:** `sudo zypper install --type pattern devel_basis`

**Note:** Most samples presented here are developed in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). If you are new to Node or Express, Take a look at [Node.js and Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8uL0lFFoN0) crash course by [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)

Getting Started
---------------
If you are comfortable and understood the concept of building Intelligent Solutions with a Loosely Coupled architecture, you are good to go. Else, take a look at the articles mentioned in the [How it Works](#how-it-works) session.  

A bit of strategy can also help you this [article about winning hackathons](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-simple-checklist-to-help-you-win-or-have-fun-at-hackathons-98030be1a6c8) have great hints.

Check our [Build Block list](#list-of-build-blocks) to get some inspiration. Also, [the samples we developed in the past](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/06/05/loosely-coupled-solutions-for-smbs-topics/#Samples) might also give you some ideas. Ask for the help of our experts if you need some guidance.

Whatever the runtime and programming language you choose, your application will run the SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry. To get an idea of how to deploy, monitor and consume services in this environment, [check the dedicated build block](CloudFoundry)
